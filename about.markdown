I am a physicist working in analytical chemistry with a strong passion for the programming language Julia . I worked as a primary investigator at the [University of Bonn](https://www.lwf.uni-bonn.de/institute/iel/institut/lmc/Fast-GC), where I developed and used [simulations of complex gas chromatographic (GC) separation system](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographyToolbox), e.g. GC×GC, for method development and optimization. Part of this work is the description of the interaction of compounds with different stationary phases used in GC with different models, like thermodynamic models and linear solvent energy relationship (LSER) models.

## Academic and Research Milestones

* **Doctorate in Analytical Chemistry (University of Bonn):** In my thesis I developed a near real time method for the measurement of airborne chemical warfare agents using thermal desorption (TD) coupled with GC and mass spectral (MS) detection.

* **Olfactory Detection:** I evaluated the loss of odorants in sample bags made of Tedlar and Nalophan and TD tubes using GC-MS. In a second study a GC-O/MS system was used to investigate off-flavors of boar taint in meat.

* **Explosives Detection and Hyper-Fast GC Development:** Collaborated on novel analytical tools for detecting explosives and contributed to the design of a [hyper-fast GC](https://www.hyperchrom.com/) system utilizing spatial thermal gradients. This effort marked the beginning of my work on gas chromatography simulation.
