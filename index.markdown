Hi, I am Jan Leppert, welcome to my personal webpage. 

I am a physicist working in analytical chemistry and work as a temporal primary investigator at the [University of Bonn](https://www.lwf.uni-bonn.de/institute/iel/institut/lmc/Fast-GC). In my **current work** I use [simulations of complex gas chromatographic (GC) separation system](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographySystems.jl), e.g. GCÃ—GC, for method development and optimization. Part of this work is the description of the interaction of compounds with different stationary phases used in GC with different models, like thermodynamic models and linear solvent energy relationship (LSER) models.

In the future, I want to use these simulations of complex GC-systems to _automatically_ optimize separations, using methods of artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve method development, especially for multidimensional GC separation.  

I did my doctorate in analytical chemistry at the University of Bonn. In my thesis I developed a near real time method for the measurement of airborne chemical warfare agents using thermal desorption (TD) coupled with GC and mass spectral (MS) detection.

In following projects I focussed on olfactory detection. I evaluated the loss of odorants in sample bags made of Tedlar and Nalophan and TD tubes using GC-MS. A GC-MS system with an additional olfactory outlet was used to investigate off-flavors of boar taint in meat.

In a continuation project I worked on the detection of explosives using GC-MS and toke part in the development of a novel [hyper-fast GC](https://www.hyperchrom.com/), which also used a new technique of a spatial thermal gradient along the GC column. As part of this project, I started to develop the [simulation of GC](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographySimulator.jl).
